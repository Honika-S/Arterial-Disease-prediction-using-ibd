# Arterial-Disease-prediction-using-ibd
*This project aims to analyze the association between IBD and arterial disease and predict the  chance of IBD patients getting an arterial disease.
*The prediction of arterial disease was performed on a dataset of 90 patients affected by IBD.The
 accuracy achieved was 85%.
 *Early diagnosis and management of arterial disease in IBD patients could significantly reduce the risk of
 complications and improve outcomes. This project provides evidence that machine learning algorithms
 can improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of arterial disease in IBD patients.
 *The prediction was based on 12 selected features using supervised learning techniques and thus
 feature ranking helped in predicting the accuracy of the result.
